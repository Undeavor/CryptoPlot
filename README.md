# CryptoPlot
Your project is a cryptocurrency price analysis dashboard built with Streamlit, designed to visualize historical price data for multiple coins stored in a local SQLite database. It allows the user to explore trends, compute statistical metrics, and apply regression models interactively â€” all offline, without relying on external APIs.
